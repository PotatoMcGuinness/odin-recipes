    <h1>Best Damn Chili</h1>
    <p>This is my best chili recipe. After years of adjusting recipes that were either too spicy or too mild, everyone loves this. Even my fiance who hates chili.</p>
    <h2>Chili Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Yes, this recipe does look like you throw everything but the kitchen sink in it, but wow is the long ingredient list worth it. You might as well just make a double batch because you'll be craving more as soon as it's gone.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until softened.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Crumble bouillon cubes over beef and add beer. Continue to cook , scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until liquid is hot, about 3 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and wine to the beef mixture. Season with chili powder, 2 tablespoons cumin, brown sugar, pepper sauce, basil, paprika, salt, oregano, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meat and vegetables are very tender and flavors have developed in the chili, about 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Mix kidney beans into beef and vegetables. Continue to simmer until beans are hot, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Blend sour cream, cilantro, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin in a food processor until smooth. Serve sour cream mixture with chili.</li>
